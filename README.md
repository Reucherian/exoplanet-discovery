# Exoplanet Discovery

## Summary

Using CNN and SVC to classify exoplanet and non-exoplanet stars with the help of flux in light intensity data.
Visualisation of the data was done with the help of animated charts using a library called ipyvizzu such animated visualization can be used to convey important details like the scale of the data or the effect of a transformation.
An integral part of this analysis was how preprocessing steps like using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and Gaussian Filtering as steps to transform the data or SMOTE to balance the data could substatinally improve our classification.

## Required Python Libraries

ipyvizzu, numpy, pandas, scipy, keras, sklearn, imblearn
